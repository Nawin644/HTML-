    <p>An Argentine international, Messi is the country's all-time leading goalscorer and also holds the<br>
         national record for appearances. At youth level, he won the 2005 FIFA World Youth Championship,<br>
          finishing the tournament with both the Golden Ball and Golden Shoe, and an Olympic gold medal <br>
          at the 2008 Summer Olympics. His style of play as a diminutive, left-footed dribbler drew <br>
          comparisons with his compatriot Diego Maradona, who described Messi as his successor. After his<br>
           senior debut in August 2005, Messi became the youngest Argentine to play and score in a FIFA Wo<br>
           rld Cup (2006), and reached the final of the 2007 Copa América, where he was named young playe<br>
           r of the tournament. As the squad's captain from August 2011, he led Argentina to three consecu<br>
           tive finals: the 2014 FIFA World Cup, for which he won the Golden Ball, the 2015 Copa América<br>
           , winning the Golden Ball, and the 2016 Copa América. After announcing his international retirement<br>
            in 2016, he reversed his decision and led his country to qualification for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, <br>
            a third-place finish at the 2019 Copa América,<br> and victory in the 2021 Copa América, while winni<br>
            ng the Golden Ball and Golden Boot for the latter. </p>
